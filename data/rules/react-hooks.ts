Core Hook Principles:
- Use hooks at the top level of functional components
- Follow the Rules of Hooks strictly
- Create custom hooks for reusable logic
- Prefer hooks over class components

Essential Hooks Patterns:
- useState for local component state
- useEffect for side effects with proper cleanup
- useContext for consuming context values
- useReducer for complex state logic
- useMemo for expensive computations
- useCallback for stable function references

Custom Hooks:
- Prefix custom hooks with 'use'
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Return consistent data structures
- Handle loading, error, and data states

Performance Optimization:
- Memoize expensive computations with useMemo
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders with memo and useCallback
- Use lazy initial state for expensive operations
- Implement proper dependency arrays`,
