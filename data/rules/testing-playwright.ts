- Cookie and session management
- Viewport and device emulation
- Geolocation and permissions

Element Interaction:
- Locator strategies (CSS, XPath, text)
- User actions (click, fill, select)
- Keyboard and mouse interactions
- File upload and download testing
- Drag and drop operations

Assertions & Expectations:
- Built-in expect assertions
- Element state verification
- Text and attribute assertions
- Screenshot comparison
- Custom assertion matchers

Network Interception:
- Request and response interception
- API mocking and stubbing
- Network condition simulation
- Response modification
- HAR file generation

Advanced Features:

- Test grouping and tagging

Authentication Testing:
- Login flow automation
- Session persistence
- Multi-factor authentication
- SSO integration testing
- Token-based authentication

Debugging & Troubleshooting:
