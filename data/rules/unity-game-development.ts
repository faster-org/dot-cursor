- Coroutines for time-based operations
- Unity Events and UnityAction
- ScriptableObjects for data containers

Physics Systems:
- Rigidbody components for physics simulation
- Collider types and collision detection
- Triggers for interaction zones
- Physics materials and constraints
- 2D vs 3D physics considerations

Animation:
- Animator Controller state machines
- Animation clips and curves
- Blend trees for smooth transitions
- Timeline for cutscenes and sequences
- Inverse kinematics (IK) setup

UI Development:
- Canvas and UI components
- Event system for user interaction
- Responsive UI design
- UI animation and tweening
- World space vs screen space UI

Graphics & Rendering:
- Shader Graph for visual effects
- Material creation and properties
- Lighting and post-processing
- Particle systems for effects
- Performance optimization techniques

Audio Implementation:
- Audio Source and Audio Listener
- Audio Mixer for sound management
- 3D spatial audio setup
- Music and sound effect integration
- Audio compression and optimization

Input Handling:
