- EBS volumes for persistent storage
- EFS for shared file systems
- Storage Gateway for hybrid cloud
- Backup and disaster recovery strategies

Database Services:
- RDS for SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- DynamoDB for NoSQL applications
- ElastiCache for in-memory caching
- Redshift for data warehousing
- Aurora for high-performance databases

Networking:
- VPC design and subnet configuration
- Security Groups and NACLs
