Flutter Core Concepts:
- Everything is a Widget philosophy
- Immutable widget trees and state management
- Hot reload for rapid development
- Platform channels for native functionality
- Custom painting and animations

Widget Development:
- StatelessWidget for immutable UI
- StatefulWidget for dynamic UI
- Use const constructors for performance
- Implement proper widget composition
- Custom widgets for reusability

State Management:
- Provider for simple state management
- Bloc pattern for complex business logic
- Riverpod for dependency injection
- GetX for rapid development
- setState for local widget state

UI Development:
- Material Design with Material widgets
- Cupertino for iOS-style design
- Custom themes and theming
- Responsive design with MediaQuery
- Accessibility implementation

Navigation & Routing:
- Navigator 2.0 for complex routing
- Named routes for simple navigation
- Route guards and middleware
- Deep linking support
- Bottom navigation and tabs

Platform Integration:
- Platform channels for native code
- Method channels for two-way communication
- Event channels for streaming data
- Plugin development
- Platform-specific implementations

Performance:
- Widget rebuilding optimization
- Image caching and optimization
- Memory management
- Profile and debug performance
- Build optimization for release

Testing:
- Unit testing with test package
- Widget testing for UI components
- Integration testing for full flows
- Golden tests for UI consistency
- Mockito for mocking dependencies

Deployment:
- Android release builds
- iOS App Store deployment
- Web deployment
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Code signing and certificates`,
