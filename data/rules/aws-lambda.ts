	content: `# AWS Lambda Serverless Functions

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for building scalable, efficient serverless applications using AWS Lambda and event-driven architecture patterns.

## Core Principles

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Design functions around event sources and triggers
   - Implement proper event handling and processing
   - Use appropriate runtime environments for your use case

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize for cold start reduction
   - Right-size memory allocation and timeout configuration
   - Implement efficient concurrency and scaling strategies

3. **Security First**
   - Follow IAM principle of least privilege
   - Encrypt environment variables and sensitive data
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization

---

## Lambda Fundamentals

4. **Function Execution Model**
   - Understand Lambda lifecycle and execution context
   - Implement proper handler function patterns
   - Manage runtime environments and versions effectively

5. **Memory and Performance Configuration**
   - Configure memory allocation based on workload
   - Set appropriate timeout values
   - Monitor and optimize execution performance

---

## Event Sources and Triggers

6. **API Gateway Integration**
   - Configure HTTP triggers and REST APIs
   - Implement proper request/response handling
   - Use custom authorizers when needed

7. **AWS Service Integration**
   - Process S3 bucket event notifications
   - Handle DynamoDB streams effectively
   - Integrate with SNS, SQS, and EventBridge

---

## Function Development

8. **Code Organization**
   - Implement clean handler function patterns
   - Use proper dependency packaging strategies
   - Organize code for maintainability and testing

9. **Environment Management**
   - Manage environment variables securely
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
   - Implement configuration best practices

---

## Runtime Support

10. **Multi-Runtime Development**
    \`\`\`javascript
    // Node.js Lambda example
    exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
        try {
            const result = await processEvent(event);
            return {
                statusCode: 200,
                body: JSON.stringify(result)
            };
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error:', error);
            return {
                statusCode: 500,
                body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Internal Server Error' })
            };
        }
    };
    \`\`\`

11. **Custom Runtime Creation**
    - Build custom runtimes when needed
    - Optimize runtime for specific use cases
    - Implement proper runtime lifecycle management

---

## Performance Optimization

12. **Cold Start Reduction**
    - Use provisioned concurrency for critical functions
    - Minimize package size and dependencies
    - Implement efficient initialization patterns

13. **Connection Pooling**
    - Reuse database connections across invocations
    - Implement proper connection management
    - Use connection pooling libraries

---

## Error Handling and Monitoring

14. **Exception Handling**
    - Implement comprehensive error handling patterns
    - Configure dead letter queues for failed executions
    - Set up proper retry policies and strategies

15. **Observability**
    - Use CloudWatch Logs and metrics effectively
    - Implement X-Ray distributed tracing
    - Create custom metrics and dashboards

---

## Security Best Practices

16. **IAM Configuration**
    - Apply principle of least privilege
    - Create function-specific IAM roles
    - Regular security audits and compliance checks

17. **VPC and Network Security**
    - Configure VPC settings when needed
    - Implement proper network security groups
    - Use encryption in transit and at rest

---

## Testing Strategies

18. **Local Development**
    - Use AWS SAM for local testing
    - Implement comprehensive unit tests
    - Test with LocalStack for offline development

19. **Integration Testing**
    - Test with actual AWS services
    - Implement automated testing in CI/CD
    - Perform load and performance testing

---

## Deployment and Infrastructure

20. **Infrastructure as Code**
    \`\`\`yaml
    # SAM template example
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
    Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31

    Resources:
      MyFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
          CodeUri: src/
          Handler: index.handler
          Runtime: nodejs18.x
          MemorySize: 256
          Timeout: 30
    \`\`\`

21. **Deployment Strategies**
    - Implement blue-green deployments
    - Use canary deployments for risk reduction
    - Automate deployment with CI/CD pipelines

---

## Advanced Features

22. **Lambda Layers**
    - Use layers for code reuse and dependency management
    - Share common libraries across functions
    - Implement proper layer versioning

23. **Container Images**
    - Use container images for complex dependencies
    - Optimize container size for performance
    - Implement proper image lifecycle management

---

## Cost Optimization

24. **Resource Optimization**
    - Right-size function memory and timeout
    - Monitor execution time and costs
    - Use reserved concurrency strategically

25. **Architecture Optimization**
    - Optimize function architecture for cost efficiency
    - Implement proper monitoring and alerting
    - Regular cost analysis and optimization
