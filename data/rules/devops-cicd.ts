Build Automation:
- Build tool integration (Maven, Gradle, npm)
- Multi-platform builds
- Dependency management
- Binary artifact creation
- Build caching strategies

Deployment Strategies:
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary releases
- Rolling deployments
- Feature flag integration
- Rollback mechanisms

Infrastructure as Code:
